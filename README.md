XKCD Hangman
------------

This programming experiment/example is an [XKCD][1]-inspired hangman game implemented as a Facebook application, in Clojure using the [clj-facebook][2] library.

It plays hangman XKCD style, with hints and a nice surprise at the end when you win!

Originally created for a presentation to show the ease of using Clojure with Facebook integration and a surprising amount of sophistication for the meager amount of code.
