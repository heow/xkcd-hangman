XKCD Hangman
============

This programming experiment/example is an [XKCD][1]-inspired hangman game implemented as a Facebook application, in Clojure using the [clj-facebook][2] library.

TODO
====

  * clean up code by migrating to the Compojure 0.4 web framework
  * add a form to submit a word/comic combination.
  * post results to the player's facebook wall
